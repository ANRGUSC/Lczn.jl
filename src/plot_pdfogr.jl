## Function Arguments
# * tracefile: The name of the .csv trace file that is assumed to be
# present in the current directory. It is assumed that each row of the
# csv file contains the RSSI readings from one access point.
#
# * rows: The rows, whose histograms are to be computed. It is assumed
# that the IDs are valid.
#
## Output
# * $tracefile_pdfogr_$i : For each $i âˆˆ ids, a histogram of the RSSI
# values are written to disk.

function plot_pdfogr(tracefile, rows)

# Read the CSV file
trace = readcsv(tracefile)

# Array of plots
plts = Array{Any}(length(rows))
